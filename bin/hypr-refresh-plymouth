# Copy Plymouth theme files from the installation_hyprland project
# Note: The actual plymouth theme files (e.g., .plymouth and .script) are not in installation_hyprland/default/plymouth/
# They would need to be created based on omarchy/default/plymouth
# For now, this script will just set the theme name.
# A more complete solution would involve copying or creating the plymouth theme files.
